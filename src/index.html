          <p>
            Since the UN Climate Change Conference in 2010, efforts have been
            made to limit global warming caused by greenhouse gases to only two
            degrees Celsius by the end of the century compared to the
            pre-industrial age. In the Paris Agreement of 2015, two degrees
            remains the goal, but the aim is to limit warming to only 1.5
            degrees.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus many scientists believe that the changes caused by global
            warming will be just manageable. If the earth warms up by more than
            these two degrees, researchers believe that drastic and irreversible
            environmental changes will occur – heatwaves, droughts, floods,
            natural disasters and the extinction of species.<br />
            If no drastic measures will soon be taken , the temperature could
            already rise by 1.5 to 7.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the
            century, depending on the scenario. Human activities have so far led
            to a global temperature increase of 1.0 degrees Celsius compared to
            the pre-industrial age, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
            Change (IPCC) declared at the beginning of October 2018.
          </p>

          <p>
            So fast, decisive action by all countries is required, as global
            emissions of greenhouse gases must be drastically reduced: In order
            not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius, CO2 emissions must be reduced by
            at least 40 percent by 2030 compared to 2010 levels. By 2050, we
            have to be climate neutral.
            <br />
            And each of us can contribute to achieving this goal by reducing our
            personal C02 emissions.

          <h1>What does meat have to do with climate change?</h1>

          <h3> In short: intensive
            animal husbandry leads to CO2 emissions.</h3> 
          <p>
            The whole thing is a concatenation of many factors. Animals need a
            lot of food until they reach slaughterable age. The forage crops in
            turn need soil to grow. These soils are originally pastureland and
            are converted into arable land by clearing. In the process, carbon
            in form of CO2 is released into the air. Fertilizers are used to
            make the plants grow faster. These chemicals consist among other
            things of animal excrements and can produce emissions in the form of
            laughing gas. This may happen if the fertilizer is not used
            carefully. Some animal species even produce emissions in the form of
            methane directly by excreting it themselves, thus polluting the
            environment.<br />
            Did you know that methane is 25 times more harmful and nitrous oxide
            350 times more harmful than CO2?
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, the stables of the animals need energy to be heated or
            lit. Depending on the type of electricity (green electricity or not)
            this point is more climate-friendly or more harmful. Another factor
            that is relevant when it comes to CO2 emissions is the transport of
            animals, meat and animal products. These are released into the air
            in the form of exhaust gases.
          </p>

          <p>
            The rainforest also has a particularly important function here. It
            is also called the green lung of the planet and has a great
            influence on the global climate. It ensures that CO2 is converted
            into oxygen through photosynthesis. However, if more and more
            rainforest is cleared for fodder cultivation and animal grazing, it
            can decompose less CO2 and more CO2 rises into the atmosphere that
            was previously bound in the forests. So, you see, it all adds up to
            a lot...

          <p>
            We have focused on the four animal species most often mentioned in
            statistics and consumed around the world. To make the visualization
            more understandable, we have formed superordinate groups of age and
            species, so that we have come to the following pictograms:

            Did you know that one kilogram of beef consumes almost 15,500 liters
            of water? That is as much as 250 five-minute showers<br /><br />
            The production of one kilogram of beef produces 60kg of methane. To
            compare: 60 kg is the weight of 274 Mc Donald’s Big Macs.<br /><br />
            Did you know that the edible proportion of beef in Germany is only
            37% of 100%? This is about the same as if you bake a cake, cut it
            into 8 equal pieces and throw 5 of them away.<br /><br />
            Did you know that 1 kg of beef, when produced outside the EU,
            requires the equivalent of 49 square meters of space? That is as
            much as a typical 1 room apartment in Germany. Only for 1 kilogram
            of beef instead of one person.<br /><br />
            In addition to meat, one must of course not forget that dairy
            products such as butter, cheese, curd cheese and milk also come from
            animals and therefore have a large CO2 impact. They are no less
            problematic compared meat.<br /><br />
            90 percent of the fresh meat in Germany comes from livestock farms.
            A cow with over 220 kilograms has only 1.8 square meters to live.
            This is only the space of when you walk two steps forward and one to
            the side.<br /><br />
            Did you know that not all regions are climate-friendly? Because feed
            that is often produced overseas and then transported to various
            farms around the world. So, it is possible that meat from
            Argentinean cattle, which live exclusively on pastureland, has a
            better ecological balance sheet than regional beef from cattle that
            are only in the barn and that are fattened with concentrated feed
            from overseas.<br /><br />
            Did you know that meat from the region does not automatically have a
            better CO2 footprint? It is not the distance from the production
            site and point of sale that is decisive, but the size of the company
            and the efficiency with which it operates. Because even in our
            region our animals eat what is produced overseas and then
            transported to various farms around the world.

          <h1>You want to know what you could do now?</h1>
          <p>
            
            We collected some easy tips how you can change your lifestyle and at
            the same time make the world a better place. You can really make a
            difference!<br /><br />

            1. Make your own rules: e.g. a "once a day/week rule", changing from
            larger to smaller quantities... And take the pressure off: every
            reduction is great! <br /><br />

            2. If you eat meat, then it should be organic and from
            species-appropriate, regional production, preferably from the direct
            marketer. Find out whether there are suppliers of organic meat in
            your region. Make sure the animal feed is not coming from overseas.
            And you just learned which animals cause the least CO2
            equivalents!<br /><br />

            3. If you miss the taste of meat, you are well served with strongly
            spiced dishes like curries. Also "as if" versions, for example
            noodles with soy Bolognese sauce or sliced meat with seitan, are a
            good alternative for some people. Others, e.g. celebrity chef Jamie
            Oliver prefer to cook without trying to replace meat - because meat
            alternatives such as tofu etc. are often not well received by meat
            eaters.<br /><br />

            4. If you fear protein deficiency by eating less meat, don ́t worry!
            You can still follow a healthy, balanced diet: Legumes, cereals and
            dairy products are high-quality sources of protein.<br /><br />
